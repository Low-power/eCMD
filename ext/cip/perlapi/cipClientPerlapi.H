     @brief Initialize eCMD CIP Extension DLL
     @param i_clientVersion Comma seperated list of eCMD Perl api major numbers this script supports, see details
     @retval ECMD_SUCCESS if successful load
     @retval ECMD_INVALID_DLL_VERSION if Dll version loaded doesn't match client version
     @retval nonzero if unsuccessful
     @post eCMD CIP Extension is initialized and version checked

     VERSIONS :
     eCMD at times has to make changes to add/remove functionality and parameters to functions.  This could cause
     incompatability in your script if you used functions that have changed.  The i_clientVersion string is used
     to tell eCMD which major releases you support such that your script will not continue execution if it encounters
     a version that is either not known about or not supported.  This is similar to how the eCMD C-Api works except in
     Perl you can support multiple versions with one script as long as the changes that were made between the versions
     do not affect your script.

     USAGE :
     if (cipInitExtension("ver3,ver4")) { die "Fatal errors initializing DLL"; }
