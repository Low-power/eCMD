        ECMD:           Core Common Function

        Function:       Puts a value for a specified register into a ring.  The first  
                        register in the scandef file that exactly matches the RegName 
                        (not including parenthesis) will be used. If the register is 
                        broken into multiple lines, the register lengths are 
                        concatenated to form one complete register.

                        With the -exact option, eCMD searches for an exact match, and 
                        will alter only the first latch that exactly matches (excluding
                        any parentheses). This option also enables searching the scandef
                        with a hash file which greatly increases performance.

        Parmeters:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Chip            Specifies the chip to operate on.
        ChipUnit [opt]  If you are using ChipUnits, you also specify your ChipUnit
                        w/o  ChipUnit: pu
                        with ChipUnit: pu.mc

        RingName        Specifies chip ring to operate on.  For a list of available
                        rings, use the ecmdquery command.

                        Ex:  ecmdquery rings memctrl
                             ecmdquery rings pu

        LatchName       Desired latchs to put in the ring.  

        Start     [opt] Offset at which to begin writing data.  Also specify Numbits.

        Numbits   [opt] Number of bits to insert.  If not specified, start = 0 and 
                        numbits is calculated from the length of the Data string.  

        Data            Data to be written to the register specified.  
                        Format specified by -i<format>

        -exact    [opt] No pattern matching. Instead, search for exact latch name. (default)

        -partial  [opt] Use pattern matching to find latch name, can be considerably slower.

        -sparse   [opt] Uses scan via scom sparse ring access to get the bits out of the ring.

        -mcast<value>   Creates a multicast scan address for the ring.
                        Value can be just multicast group number, or fully encoded first byte of address to use.

        -i<format>[opt] Specifies the format type of input data : default 'xl'
                        Run 'ecmdquery formats' to view available formats

        -b<mod>[opt]    Bit modifier to apply to current ring data.
                        Run 'ecmdquery formats' to view available modifiers

                        Run 'ecmdquery options' for a list of the global command line
                        options and their definitions
